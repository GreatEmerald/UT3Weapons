KNOWN ISSUES
------------
Weapons:
1. Impact Hammer: It doesn't knock items off players.
2. Enforcer, Stinger, Sniper: The tracer colour is not the same.
3. Biorifle: It doesn't have the blob at the end of it once charged.
4. Shock Rifle: The skin isn't entirely the same, however, it can't be due to UE2 limitations. Will use particles later.
5. AVRiL: The lock on crosshair isn't right.
6. Rocket Launcher: It charges faster than its animation shows.
7. Translocator: The EM field skin might show some anomalies.

Vehicles:
1. Leviathan: Doesn't have destroyable turrets.
2. Hellfire SPMA: Bot support isn't complete.
3. Scorpion: Can steer too good when boosting.
4. Overall: Steering and speed might feel incorrect.
5. Vehicles still use UT2004 meshes.

Instagib:
1. No zoom Instagib yet.

Overall:
1. Please note that the feeling might be not identical to UT3 as the values were usually just copied over from UT3 to UT2004. Yet that way you still have some UT2004 feel which eliminates most issues people mention about original UT3 weapons.
2. Not tested online thoroughly, but should work for the most part.

DESCRIPTION
-----------

Unreal Tournament 3 weapons, pickups and vehicles converted to Unreal Tournament 2004. This pack gives you four mutators:
1. UT3 Weapons:
Version: Beta 2.0
All of the weapons from UT3 converted for use in UT2004. That includes sounds, functionality, visuals and icons.

2. UT3 Vehicles:
Version: Beta 1.1
All the vehicles converted from UT3 for use in UT2004. That includes sounds, functionality, tooltips and some visuals.

3. UT3 Instagib:
Version: Beta 1.0
Instagib with UT3 Instagib Rifles.

4. UT3 Like the Back of My Hand:
Version: Beta 1.0
A mutator that emulates the UT3 achievement "Like the Back of My Hand". It displays the amount of pickups on the map and gives you an announcement and logs it if you manage to find all the pickups in a map.


-----
NOTES
-----

Works very well with some versions of the map VCTF-Suspense2K4 to bring the UT3 feeling to UT2004.

OTHER PROJECTS
